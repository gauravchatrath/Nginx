As a system administrator with your organization, you've been tasked with setting up a new web server to serve static web assets. 
Your organization mandates the use of CentOS 7 for all new servers, and you've decided to deploy the newest stable build of NGINX from the official NGINX repository.

After you've installed NGINX, you'll need to ensure that it's running and will run automatically after a reboot. 
Lastly, you must configure the server to handle requests for assets.example.com from the directory /var/www/assets.example.com/. Once you've tested the configuration, you're ready to notify the web developers in your organization.
